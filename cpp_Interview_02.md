| **Feature**                    | **Interface Class**                                                                                                         | **Abstract Class**                                                                                                                                          |

| **Definition**                 | A class where **all methods are pure virtual** (i.e., `= 0`) and typically contains no data members or implemented methods. | A class that contains **at least one pure virtual method**, but can also have non-pure virtual methods and data members.                                    |
| **Purpose**                    | Provides a **strict contract** for derived classes, ensuring they implement all methods.                                    | Used to define a **base class** with some shared behavior, allowing derived classes to inherit functionality while customizing parts of it.                 |
| **Implementation**             | No implementation for methods; all methods are pure virtual (`virtual void method() = 0;`).                                 | May contain a mix of pure virtual methods, regular virtual methods, and non-virtual methods.                                                                |
| **Data Members**               | Typically contains **no data members**, although technically allowed.                                                       | Can have **data members**.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Constructor**                | No constructor is typically required or used.                                                                               | Can have a constructor to initialize data members.                                                                                                          |
| **Usage**                      | Used when derived classes should have **no shared implementation** but must implement the interface.                        | Used when derived classes **may share common functionality** defined in the base class.                                                                     |
| **Instantiation**              | Cannot be instantiated.                                                                                                     | Cannot be instantiated if it contains at least one pure virtual function.                                                                                   |
| **Multiple Inheritance**       | Commonly used with multiple inheritance as it avoids ambiguity in shared behavior.                                          | Used in multiple inheritance but may introduce ambiguity if there are shared implementations.                                                               |
| **Derived Class Requirements** | Derived classes **must implement all pure virtual methods**.                                                                | Derived classes **must implement all pure virtual methods** but can inherit other methods or data members.                                                  |
